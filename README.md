### Blog app on learning rails ###

#### How do I get started? ####
- Clone the repo.
- Run `bundle install`.
- Then setup your db; you may use `rake db:setup`.
- Next would be to start the app. You will need to install foreman gem (`gem install foreman`) if you don't have it already, and run:
 ```foreman start```
This will start sunspot solr, and run your rails app on a webrick server usning port 3000.
